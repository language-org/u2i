Project: Intent recognition    

* Steeve
  * Approach 1
      * Supervised intent classification  
          * model development and comparison on single label corpus
          * find explainable model with near SOTA performance

  * Approach 2
      * Unsupervised intent (label) discovery  
          * clustering: flat and herarchical (2)
          * knowledge graph (semantic) based similarity metrics (my principal focus) 
          * intent discovery
              * Shallow semantics
              * Semantic grammars 
                  * syntactic parsing
                  * slot filling
              * Probabilistic semantic grammar
              * Semantic hidden markov models
              * Neural models (not a priority)  

  * Corpus
      * Focus on Banking77 (financial)
      * Others identified (see my corpora survey)

    * Suggestions
        * Clustering (any would work, do not spend too much time on that one, make it as easy as possible)
        * Extract intents (most INTERESTING one !): Automatic labelling (intent detection)
            * express as predicate-object (look Tiziano's notebook)
            * ontology might help --> superclasses and synonyms
        * Interprete the clusters (hierarchical clustering, look at the centroid, high information, ngram tokens)
        * Check whether retrieved labels are seamtically close to ground truth
            * Start with human evalution: we can have someone assign a numerical rating to the quality of the labels retrieved first
                * maybe reduce the number of intents first
                * use word nets first  
            * if humans are able to qualify the labels then it makes sense to use knowledge based semantic distances (cost/benefits might not be that great)  
                * no need for the model to have more discriminative capacity than the human
            
        * Might be related to the ontology toolbox in NLP resource

        * Internal process: Julian Fowler, Ben M., Patrick Bennani, Stephane T.  
        * ask CRI project only if it's almost ready, risk being replaced by someone else if not available   

* Scientific paper is too high bar (20% ok !)
