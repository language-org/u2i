## Objectives

* Application task
  * Task-oriented dialogue agent [6]  
    * rationale: 
      * we found the largest corpora

* Success metrics (precision, recall, F1)
  * Good cross-domains performance
  * or Very good performance for a specific domain
  * very good generalization perf. within-domain

* Prototype

    ( "blabalbakbaa asad asdad", (in-scope), (intent_1, intent_2) )
    ( "blabalbakbaxueriu asad asdad", (out-scope), (new_intent_x, new_intent_y) )  

* Keep the same scheme as scikit-learn to facilitate adoption  

## Approaches  
  
  * candidate 1
    * Hierarchical classifier, multilabel classifier [2] 
  * candidate 2
    * 1. training
      * 1. train a domain-classifier
      * 2. for each domain train a within-domain intent classifier         
    * 2. Prediction: 
      * 1. get domain w/ domain classifier
      * 2. get intent w/ within-domain intent classifier
    
  * dependencies
	  * scikit-learn
	  * spaCy

* Questions: 
	* Compare to ML pipeline text --> vectorized text (TF/IDF or w2v or ELMO) --> sklearn classifer (Ben M.)
	* Can we reach neural net performance with more interpretable ML (Steeve)
