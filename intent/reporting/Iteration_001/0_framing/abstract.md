Text and speech intent recognition are central tasks in Natural Language Processing, with widespread industry applications. Their main application, Conversational AI, will alone be worth $14 Billion in 2025, reflecting the ever-increasing demand for AI-powered customer support and engagement. State of the art intent extraction models are predominantly supervised: NLP researchers and practitioners have crafted sophisticated models that compete in performance and in complexity on benchmark corpora of annotated queries. Models are typically classification or sequence models trained on databases of annotated queries then used to predict intents on unseen utterances. But despite the approachâ€™s growing popularity, it relies on extensive human annotations and its opacity provides little to no insights into the structure of intent representation. The unsupervised approach, far less explored, could be used to reduce labelling workload while enabling the elaboration of a clear and concise formal model of natural language intent. We will  review key questions on intent recognition, predominant approaches and our preliminary results with an unsupervised approach to intent parsing.
