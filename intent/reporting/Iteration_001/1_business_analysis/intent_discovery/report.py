# **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
# * A
# * B
#
# **APPROACH**
#
# 1. Classification:
#   * Is there enough predictive lexical information in utterances to discriminate between intents
#       * [Q]: Does low performance impair the quality of intent parsing ?
#   * Characterise the predictive information:
#       * the lexicon clearly differ b/w intents (clustering)
#       * lexicon very stereotyped and redundant within an intent cluster
#       * [Q]: Do overlapping lexicons or/and diverse lexicons impair the quality of intent parsing?
#   * Does sentence type impair classification performance ?
#       * why ?
# 2. Intent detection:
#   * assess whether an intent is expressed or not
# 3. Intent parsing:
#   * when an intent is expressed: extract it
#       * syntactical parsing?
#       * constituency parsing?
#       * `intent-indicator`
# 4. Compair w/ freer (less stereotyped/constrained) utterances:
#   * Questions expressed in Forums?
