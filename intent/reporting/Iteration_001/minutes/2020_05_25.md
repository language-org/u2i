purpose: NLP resource for intent classification  


* Oleg Polivin:  
	* 2 days he joined the project  
	* would like a chatbot that can speak with a person and ask about the symptoms of the virus  
	* Hielke did that with a heart disease chatbot  (age, weights, eating habits), slot filling and RASA approach
	* Altran division ni Paris but worked on a chatbot to translate to french  
	* Create chatbot for Covid19  
	* If they mention headache is that a symptome or the root cause problem  
	* timeline of the project  
* Ben Mathiesen:  
	* Intent classification module requirements:  
		* first approach should not be SOTA.. it is often not worth the cost and difficult to improve
		* is the model lighweight and heavy (many GB) ?  
		* We can upload our own corpus (text / intent) to train the model
		* Does the user obtain their own version of the model in this case?
		* Can we download the trained model to use for a client project?
		* Can you find a public corpus of question / intent to try it out on?
		* Compare to ML pipeline text --> vectorized text (TF/IDF or w2v or ELMO) --> sklearn classifer
		* Another interesting question would be to incorporate multilabel classifier (one question can have multiple intents)
		* check Google api
	* stay up-to-date with Oleg and possibly collaborate
